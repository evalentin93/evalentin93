# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Eduardo Valentin dos Santos and I'm a geologist working my way through programming.<br><br>
ðŸŒ± This journey with Python and Data Science started mid 2019. I'm studying while doing my Ph.D. in geology and I intend to use my developing skills to solve real problems as I come up with new ideas. It is my dream to find a job where I can apply both my programming and geology skills.<br><br>
